    details: `A dealership is designed to turn a profit, unlike a private buyer. Because of this, you will generally get less for your goods. The plus side of selling or trading in a bike at a dealership is that you have the potential to get rid of your bike right away. Dealerships also tend to accommodate the rider by ensuring a smooth transaction process.

      It’s important to note when evaluating these two methods that just because you’ll get the most out of your price with a private party, it doesn’t mean you’ll get the most out of your sale. One advantage that selling to a dealership can have is the convenience and smooth transaction process. Dealing with private buyers can sometimes be risky, and it’s vital to vet whomever you’re selling to, but more so the private buyers.`

      'As with a new car, buying a new motorcycle can be very expensive. If you don’t have the money or have bad credit, buying a used or second-hand motorcycle may be a better option. Used bikes are also suitable for beginners looking for entry-level bikes before going into the big league. You can buy a used motorcycle in the same way you buy a used car. However, just like buying a used car, there are some things you need to know about the sales platform before you make a decision. See and examine before you buy. A basic 125 cc motorcycle may be easier to examine than a scooter, but there is an essential trick, and that is to find out from a friend who has a motorcycle model the same as the one you want or from a workshop, what are the areas of the motorcycle in which special attention must be paid.'
